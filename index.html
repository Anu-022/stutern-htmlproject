    <h1>Fried Rice</h1>
    <p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice</p>

    <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Parboil chicken and liver (both together) with all the spices (a teaspoon of salt, half cup of sliced onions, a teaspoon of thyme spice, a teaspoon of curry, two seasoning cubes teaspoon each of powdered ginger and garlic).

            Allow the meat to cook for ten to fifteen minutes, taste for salt, then pick out and deep-fry. Be sure to reserve the stock (meat water)</li>
        <li>Chop the cabbage, green beans, carrot, liver and set aside in a wide tray as you can find in the video below or the image above.

            This process is easy, I normally use just a knife and chopping board or a tray.
            
            The sample image below shows you some ingredients in small quantities.Parboil the 4 cups of rice also and cook with half of the meat stock (water from the meat) and two cups of water, cook until it is about 70% done.

            Observe the rice closely. It doesn’t need to be too soft or too hard, just almost done.</li>
        <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, allow drying, then pour in about 200ml of vegetable oil.

            Note: It is better to continue with the same oil you used while frying the meat (that is only if you fried the meats), you can reduce it to 200ml.</li>
        <li>Allow heating, then add the sliced onions, stir for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped carrot and green beans, any of these two can actually go first.

            Add the chopped liver and sweet corn, stir.
            
            Meat stock (water from the meat) should follow, add ground pepper (optional), add a teaspoon of salt and, add 1 seasoning cube then stir and taste, you may add more salt.</li>
        <li>Add the green peas.Stir for 1-2 minutes then add cabbage and the curry powder (Curry is a yellowish spice that actually adds the yellowish color to fried rice, add and stir till you are satisfied with the color.)

            You would have a yellowish mixture that would often taste overly spiced, don’t worry the rice would balance the taste.</li>
    </ol>
